#Repositories:
  I will be creating a repository for each of the projects that we will be completing during this semester. This means Project 1-5 and the POE as well.

#Names of the repositories:
  - CMPG323-Overview-37569368. This is the repository for Project 1 where we will document and keep track of all the other projects.
  - CMPG323-Project 2-37569368.
  - CMPG323-Project 3-37569368.
  - CMPG323-Project 4-37569368.
  - CMPG323-Project 5-37569368.
  - CMPG323-POE-37569368. This will be the repository for the Portfolio of Evidence required for this module at the end of the semester.

#Branching strategies:

Branching strategies in Git are approaches used by teams to manage code through different branches, defining rules for creating, naming, and merging 
branches. They enable collaboration, stability, and efficient release management, ensuring a consistent and productive development workflow.

Each of my projects will have a Main branch that will never contain unreleased code that is not suitable for the integrated environment. It will only contain 
finished and tested code that is usable in a working environment.

All my projects will also have a Development branch where all my new ideas and code will be added and tested to analyze if it will be suitable and advantageous
for this project to ensure an efficient and high-quality program.

#.gitignore file:

The .gitignore file is a file that is used to ensure that certain files are untracked by the git system. It allows you to not share any files to GitHub that 
you don't want to share. 

This allows you to only commit the suitable and complete code to the repository without making any mistakes to your code already uploaded to GitHub, meaning you 
can have a testing file where you test and add all your new code. If you are happy with your code then you can just add it to your main project file and only commit 
the main file and include the testing file in the .gitignore file. This means that when you commit only the main file will be committed then.

#Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information:

As for storing sensitive and private information, it is very important to keep a close eye on what will be added to the GitHub repository. Fortunately, I have made my 
repository private which is there as a failsafe if I accidentally upload or expose private information like my credentials or maybe an API key which is also very sensitive
information. It is important to ensure that version control systems like Git, should never store sensitive information directly in code files or commit history since it 
is then accessible by others than myself. An accidental commit containing sensitive data can most likely lead to a security breach.

This is where a .gitignore file is very useful since you can store sensitive information like the API keys, meaning that they would be excluded in the commit to GitHub 
and this means that it will prevent Git from tracking and sharing these files with sensitive information. It is also important to note that hardcoding sensitive information
into the source code and committing them is a big no. The last thing is you have to be very cautious when sharing a repository that could contain sensitive information and 
should only be shared with people that you trust.
